abstract = {Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are an important tool in the field of clinical medicine, brain research and the study of neurological diseases. EEG is very susceptible to a variety of physiological signals, which brings great difficulties to the research and analysis of EEG signals. Therefore, removing noise from EEG signals is a key prerequisite for analyzing EEG signals. In this paper, a one-dimensional residual Convolutional Neural Networks (1D-ResCNN) model for raw waveform-based EEG denoising is proposed to solve the above problem. An end-to-end (i.e. waveform in and waveform out) manner is used to map a noisy EEG signal to a clean EEG signal. In the training stage, an objective function is often adopted to optimize the model parameters and in the test stage, the trained 1D-ResCNN model is used as a filter to automatically remove noise from the contaminated EEG signal. The proposed model is evaluated on the EEG signal from the CHB-MIT Scalp EEG Database, and the added noise signals are obtained from the database. We compared the proposed model with the independent of the composite analysis (ICA), the fast independent composite analysis (FICA),Recursive least squares(RLS) filter,Wavelet Transform (WT) and Deep neural network(DNN) models. Experimental Results show that the proposed model can yield cleaner waveforms and achieve significant improvement in SNR and RMSE.Meanwhile, the proposed model can also preserve the nonlinear characteristics of EEG signals.}

abstract = {Objective
In telemedicine, dynamic electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring is important for preventing and diagnosing cardiovascular diseases. However, the interference of the external environment causes a large amount of noises in the dynamic ECG signal, affecting the subsequent automated analysis. Therefore, reduction of the noises in the ECG signal is particularly important.
Approach
This study proposed a novel ECG signal denoising algorithm based on the deep factor analysis. The major technical innovations include a layer-by-layer denoising deep neural network built based on the factor analysis, in which a top-down strategy is used to reconstruct the signal. The Gaussian-distribution noise can be effectively removed at each layer; and complex noises can be represented by the sum of Gaussian components, thus also removed by the proposed deep network. Moreover, the noise reduction of the network is further improved through a supervised fine-tuning of the parameters of the proposed deep network model, thus increasing the robustness of the whole system in clinical applications.
Results
The excellent performance of the proposed method has been verified on the MIT-BIH database, and the noise reduction results are evaluated using the signal-to-noise ratio and root mean square error.
Significance
First of all, the algorithm does not rely on the setting of the frequency domain information and the threshold. Secondly, the algorithm preserves useful information while removing noises from the ECG signal. Finally, a gradient descent algorithm is used to supervise the training of the network, which can learn and preserve the small waveform features in the ECG signal. The performance of noise reduction is outstanding.}
